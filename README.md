# cfDNA-Flow


## 1. Overview
cfDNA-Flow facilitates the accurate and reproducible analysis of cfDNA WGS data. It offers various preprocessing options to accommodate different experimental setups and research needs in the field of liquid biopsies.

## 2. Preprocessing options
### 2.1 Trimming Options
cfDNA-Flow provides the flexibility to either trim or not trim the input reads based on the user's requirements. Trimming removes low-quality bases, which can impact downstream analyses.

### 2.2 Reference Genome Selection
Users can choose from the following genome builds: hg19, hs37d5 (hg19decoy), hg38 and hg38 without alternative contigs (hg38noalt). For download links, please refer to the Data Availability section in the accompanying paper.

### 2.3 Post-Alignment Filtering and GC bias correction
The pipeline uses the BWA software for alignment, followed by extensive post-alignment filtering steps to ensure reliable alignments. Users can define specific filtering criteria to remove low-quality or ambiguous reads, such as secondary alignments, reads with insertion or deletion, and reads with low mapping qualities. Additionally, the pipeline offers an option to correct for GC bias.

## 3. Feature Extraction

### 3.1 Fragment length features

cfDNA-Flow offers fragment length analysis; calculating the mean, median, and standard deviation values for fragments sized 100 to 220 base pairs (bp), corresponding to the mononucleosomal size range. Additionally, cfDNA-Flow calculates the frequencies of cfDNA fragment sizes ranging from 70 bp to 1000 bp in 10 bp bins.

### 3.2 Copy number changes
cfDNA-Flow utilizes two copy number analysis tools: ichorCNA (v0.2.0) and tMAD, to estimate copy number changes and tumor fraction.

### 3.3 Normalized coverage
cfDNA-Flow splits the genome into 1-Mbp bins and counts the number of fragments in each region. It then scales the 1-Mbp bin-wise fragment counts by dividing them by the average number of fragments across all bins. This scaled coverage is used to calculate Pearsonâ€™s correlation between healthy and cancer samples. When calculating the correlation of the coverage of a healthy sample to the average coverage of healthy samples, the given healthy sample is excluded from the average.

## 4. Usage
To use the cfDNA-Flow, follow these steps:

### 4.1 Installation:
Clone the cfDNA-Flow repository from GitHub.

Install required python dependencies:

Install required R packages:

    R -f install_packages.R  

### 4.2 Configuration:
        Edit the configuration file to specify the input files, reference genome, and desired preprocessing options.
        Customize the trimming, alignment, and filtering settings as needed.

### 4.3 Execution/Demo:
To start preprocessing, execute the following command. Use the -np flag for a dry run to verify everything works correctly.

        snakemake -s Snakefile --configfile test/test_cfDNA_pipeline.yaml -j 2 do_preprocess -np 

If successful, rerun the command without the -np flag.

        snakemake -s Snakefile --configfile test/test_cfDNA_pipeline.yaml -j 2 do_preprocess 

Next, bed to process BED files, use:

        snakemake -s Snakefile --configfile test/test_cfDNA_pipeline.yaml -j 2 do_bedprocess
        
Do unique counts:

        snakemake -s Snakefile --configfile test/test_cfDNA_pipeline.yaml -j 2 do_uniq_counts

Do global length: 

        snakemake -s Snakefile --configfile test/test_cfDNA_pipeline.yaml -j 2 do_global_length

Do tMAD

Do ichorCNA

### 4.4 Output:
The pipeline outputs processed reads, alignment files (BAM files, BED files), and comprehensive quality control reports.
