# tMAD scripts

These scripts use the code developed by Dineika Chandra published at https://github.com/sdchandra/tMAD, with slight modifications to allow for using bed-files as input instead of bam files.

To this end, functions of CNAClinic are also used. https://github.com/sdchandra/CNAclinic 

The code for these scripts were adapted by Siyuan Luo, Ivna Ivankovic, Todor Gitchev and Zsolt Bal√°zs
